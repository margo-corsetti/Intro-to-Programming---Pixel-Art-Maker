# Intro-to-Programming---Pixel-Art-Maker

This is my third project for Udacity's Intro to Programming class

Languages: Javascript, HTML, and CSS

Project Summary: HTML and CSS code for a pixel art maker are provided. I coded the javascript to allow for user interaction. The user selects grid size, pixel color, and can color each square by clicking on it. The grid is refreshed if the user selects "submit"
